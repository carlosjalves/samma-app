# SAMMA app - Master's Thesis in Design and Multimedia

My master's thesis focuses on the development of an analytical application for the visualization of satellite data, addressing challenges in interpreting and managing the growing complexity of space activities.

The field of information visualization plays a pivotal role in transforming large and abstract datasets into intuitive and comprehensible visual representations, an increasingly critical need in the digital age. This is particularly relevant in the space sector, where the exponential growth of satellites in orbit—driven by the demand for space-based services—has resulted in a significant increase in space debris, posing threats to the sustainability and safety of space operations.

Given these challenges, my research explores innovative approaches to visualizing and interacting with satellite-related data, focusing on enabling effective monitoring and analysis of the complex dynamics between active satellites and debris. The project involved:

- Prototyping various visualization models, tailored to the multidimensional and dynamic nature of satellite data.

- Developing and integrating these prototypes into a fully functional analytical application.

- Conducting a usability and user experience evaluation in a real-world context to refine the application and ensure it meets user needs.

This thesis highlights how data visualization can serve as a critical tool for navigating the complexities of satellite operations, contributing to safer and more sustainable space activities.
